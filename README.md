# PYprogramming

This source code actually I saw from this  pythonprogramming.net and also his youtube bit.ly/33FVxJ0. He is really kind. Well, in this source code I modified some kind of his source code to understand how python work as a deep learning tools

1. You can just run the code
2. You must donwload the dataset from Dogs vs Cats dataset from Microsoft  Don’t forget to install tqdm, when I code this thing. I am using python3 so I used pip3 to install tqdm. pip3, not pip ok!
3. CNN in python



Love Your Code ;)
